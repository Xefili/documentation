## `/articles`

This endpoint allows the method `GET` and returns an array of articles, preferably in this layout:
<customspacer />
```json
// json
{
    "id": 0,
    "title": "The title of the article",
    "content": "The text, (can contain HTML, safe)",
    "time": {
        "year": 2024,
        "month": 1,
        "day": 31,
        "hhmm": "16:40"
    },
    "tags": [
        "usually empty", "not implemented"
    ],
    "customLink": null, // reserved, is usually null but can be a string
}
```
<customspacer />
## `documentation`

This endpoint allows the method `GET` and returns an array of every page, aswell as the first and all second headings on the respective pages.
<Warning content="Third headings are not supported!" title="Warning" />
The syntax should look like this:

```json
// json
{
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Page - Heading",
    "relativeLink": "/Section/Page#Heading"
}
```
This endpoint is used for the search, as the api supports full text search.
