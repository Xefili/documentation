# Design Choices

When developing the page at the beginning, I had no clue about the style I wanted to go into. There were key features which I wanted to have in the page, such as a dark mode and a blog. In the end, those features made it into the final website.

## Main page

The main page is divided into these sections, linking the different parts of the website together. This design also was really easy to adapt to mobile devices, a feature that took a long time. More on mobile layout and changes [here](/en/Main%20Page/Media%20Changes).
